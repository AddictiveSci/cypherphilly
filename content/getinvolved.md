## Tools and Technologies:


### **Neo4j** 

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is a graph database management system developed by Neo4j, Inc. Described by its developers as an ACID-compliant transactional database with native graph storage and processing, Neo4j is the most popular graph database according to DB-Engines ranking.

Neo4j is available in a GPL3-licensed open-source "community edition", with online backup and high availability extensions licensed under the terms of the Affero General Public License. Neo also licenses Neo4j with these extensions under closed-source commercial terms.

Neo4j is implemented in Java and accessible from software written in other languages using the Cypher Query Language through a transactional HTTP endpoint, or through the binary "bolt" protocol.

### **Cypher** 
[Cypher](https://neo4j.com/cypher-graph-query-language/)
 is a vendor-neutral open graph query language employed across the graph ecosystem. Cypherâ€™s ASCII-art style syntax provides a familiar, readable way to match patterns of nodes and relationships within graph datasets.

Like SQL, Cypher is a declarative query language that allows users to state what actions they want performed (such as match, insert, update or delete) upon their graph data without requiring them to describe (or program) exactly how to do it.

Two years ago, Neo4j, Inc. decided to open source the Cypher language and make the most popular graph query language available to any technology provider with the aim that Cypher become the "SQL for graphs." Thus, the openCypher project was born.



### **OpenRefine**

[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data.

Please note that since October 2nd, 2012, Google is not actively supporting this project, which has now been rebranded to OpenRefine. Project development, documentation and promotion is now fully supported by volunteers. Find out more about the history of OpenRefine and how you can help the community.
